In several fields of science, there is such a need to visualize vector fields in two or three dimensions, as it is important in certain manufacturing industries. There are several examples of vector fields, like, the gravitational field, magnetic field, electric field, blood flow, and many other examples out there in nature. In this report we are going to focus on how to visualize these different kinds of fields and the methods used in this process. The used techniques nowadays differ in the way and the function of representing vector fields as magnitude, direction, and critical points.
